Some films are so bad, they're good. Meaning "fun" or "entertaining" or at least "interesting"... But few films can claim to be so dreadful, you actually feel physical pain while viewing them. So bad are these damned few that you don't experience them or watch them: you "endure" them. This is the mother of all such films!

"Manos the hands of fate" is without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made. Its poorness is so extreme that of itself it is the film's strongest selling point. The script is non-existent, the acting makes Steven Seagal look like a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the editing could have been less horrendously botched by a blind Eskimo with no arms. It is also painfully slow. this film makes might barely last 70 minutes but you will feel like you've aged ten years by the end of it. That's what makes a film truly bad: the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!

Many people look back at the sixties and think, with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output, that "they don't make them like this anymore!". Watching "Manos..." would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.

In the end I can not advise against this strongly enough. This is for the masochist in you (or the sadist if you insist on showing it to friends). Any other part of your person can only feel pained or offended by such extreme trash!
